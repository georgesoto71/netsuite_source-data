# dbt_netsuite_source v0.5.0
ðŸŽ‰ Netsuite2 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
PRs [#15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/15) and [#17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/17) include the following update to the dbt_netsuite_source package:
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed. To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough columns in the following format:
> This applies to all passthrough columns within the `dbt_netsuite_source` package and not just the `customers_pass_through_columns` example.
```yml
vars:
  customers_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
      transform_sql: "cast(field_alias as string)" # Optional: If you wish to define the datatype or apply a light transformation.
```
## Features
- Addition of the `data_model` variable. This variable may either be `netsuite` (the original Netsuite connector endpoint) or `netsuite2` (the new Netsuite2 connector endpoint).
  - The variable is set to `netsuite` by default. If you wish to run the data models for the Netsuite2 connector, you may simply change the variable within your root dbt_project.yml to `netsuite2`.
# dbt_netsuite_source v0.4.2
## Features
- Removed the `_fivetran_synced` column definition from the `get_customers_columns` macro, as this is consistent with other macros in the project. Previously, this introduced a bug that caused an ambiguous column name error when passing the `_fivetran_synced` column to the `customers_pass_through_columns` variable since the column is not actually listed in the `stg_netsuite__customers` model field list. Now, when passing the `_fivetran_synced` column to the pass through variable, the ambiguous column error no longer happens. ([#16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/16))

# dbt_netsuite_source v0.4.1

## Features
- Added this changelog to capture iterations of the package!
- Added the `subsidiaries_pass_through_columns` variable to be leveraged within the `stg_netsuite__subsidiaries` model. This variable will allow users to pass through fields which are not natively included to the package staging model. This variable is empty by default and may be overridden within a users root `dbt_project.yml`. ([#13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/13))
- Added the `consolidated_exchange_rates_pass_through_columns` variable to be leveraged within the `stg_netsuite__consolidated_exchange_rates` model. This variable will allow users to pass through fields which are not natively included to the package staging model. This variable is empty by default and may be overridden within a users root `dbt_project.yml`. ([#13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/13))

# dbt_netsuite_source v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
