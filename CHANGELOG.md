# dbt_netsuite_source v0.3.2

## Features
- Added this changelog to capture iterations of the package!
- Added the `customers_pass_through_columns` variable to be leveraged within the `stg_netsuite__customers` model. This variable will allow users to pass through fields which are not natively included to the package staging model. This variable is empty by default and may be overridden within a users root `dbt_project.yml`. ([#10](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/10))
- Added the `locations_pass_through_columns` variable to be leveraged within the `stg_netsuite__locations` model. This variable will allow users to pass through fields which are not natively included to the package staging model. This variable is empty by default and may be overridden within a users root `dbt_project.yml`. ([#10](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite_source/pull/11))
